## Overview

Rock Paper Scissors is a simple yet entertaining game that has been around for ages. This website is a digital version of the classic game, allowing players to compete against a computer opponent. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a responsive design that works on various screen sizes.

Players can choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking the corresponding button on the screen, and the computer opponent will randomly select its move. The winner is determined when a player reaches 5 points based on the traditional rules of the game, with rock beating scissors, paper beating rock, and scissors beating paper.
This project was part of [The Odin Project's Foundation course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).

## Difficulties

Although the development of this project was not overly difficult, there were still some challenges that I faced along the way. One of the main difficulties was the need to use a large number of if statements to implement the game's logic, which required careful consideration and planning to ensure that the code was both efficient and effective.

## Overcoming difficulties

Despite this, I was able to overcome these challenges through careful planning and attention to detail, and was able to successfully create a functional and enjoyable Rock Paper Scissors game

## Conclusion

In summary, developing the Rock Paper Scissors website was a fulfilling experience that allowed me to apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and enjoyable game. Along the way, I also had the opportunity to enhance my understanding and usage of Git, which has proved useful in subsequent projects. This project not only helped me to create well-structured code but also allowed me to gain practical experience in front-end web development..
